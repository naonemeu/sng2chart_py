### About

A Python 3 script that converts old chart data from .sng/.xml format (Freetar Editor) to the .chart format (Clone Hero) - used by [Moonscraper Chart Editor](https://github.com/FireFox2000000/Moonscraper-Chart-Editor) and other tools.

Code done by chathpt, I just instrcuted it how to "convert" a XML string into a chart one.

### Why?

I don't know either.

Should be obvious, but this won't magically make a freetar chart a good one.
