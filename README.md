### About

A Python 3 script that converts old chart data from "Freetar Editor" (sng/xml) to a better charting format (chart) - used by [Moonscraper Chart Editor](https://github.com/FireFox2000000/Moonscraper-Chart-Editor) and other tools

Code done by chathpt (yay!), I just instrcuted it how to "convert" a XML string into a chart one.

### Usage

Download the script "sng2chart.py", install Python 3 if you haven't, and run the script either by dragging a sng/xml file or by opening it.

### Why?

I don't know either.
